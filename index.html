        It was in the spring of that year that she met Pierre Curie.
Their marriage marked the start of a partnership that was soon 
to achieve results of world significance,<br> in particular 
the discovery of polonium, so called by Marie in honour of her native land. <br>

    The birth of her two daughters, Irène and Ève, in 1897 and 1904, did not interrupt
     Marie’s intensive scientific work. She was appointed lecturer in physics at 
     the École Normale Supérieure for girls in Sèvres (1900) and introduced there a 
     method of teaching based on experimental demonstrations. In December 1904 
    she was appointed chief assistant in the laboratory directed by Pierre Curie.
